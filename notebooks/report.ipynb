    "As of today, global warming remains the biggest challenge for the human race. There are, however, multiple ways of tackling the problem and one of those potential solutions is explored at EPFL by a team of dedicated students. Their method relies on capturing CO<sub>2</sub> directly from the atmosphere by the means of adsorbents. Adsorbent materials offer a useful property of accumulating a substance without causing any critical changes to either the adsorbent or the substance being adsorbed. The quality and the efficiency of the adsorbent is heavily reliant on a multitude of characteristics such as the pore volume which corresponds to the volume of the void spaces in the adsorbent or the BET surface area which is the total surface area available for adsorption per unit mass of material. The problem lies in the fact that one would have to not only read through thousands of papers when searching for the adsorbent but would also need to keep track of all of the work. That's when our project comes into play. \n",

The layout of the application was fully defined in the <code>layout.py</code>. Each Div with an interactive function was defined with a Dash object (either <code>dash_core_components</code> or <code>dash_bootstrap_components</code>) associated with an ID and a \"callback\" function to link it with the rest of the app. The difference between dcc and dbc is mainly the way that predefined styles can be implemented. \n",

    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify; max-width:90%\">\n",
    "Special functions called \"callbacks\" are a core mechanism of Dash apps. Callbacks enable interactivity within the application, meaning they listen to the user's actions by the user and give an output as a function of the inputs. For example, let's say the user selects a new x-axis for the plot. This causes the evaluation of the x-axis callback, which returns a new output. In turn, this automatically triggers the reevaluation of the plotting callback, which takes the output of the x-axis callback as input (among other things). Our app runs on a web of interconnected callbacks, which make our app so easy to interact with. To link a callback to another one, the use of individual IDs for each interactive element on the page was necessary. Indeed, each dynamic element is associated with a callback that takes some other callbacks' returns as inputs, identified by their ID, and outputs some information. Additionally, each callback, on top of having an ID, has different properties, such as <code>'value'</code>, <code>'data'</code>, <code>'children'</code> or <code>'n-clicks'</code>. The property of interest is chosen according to the element of the class that it modifies. For example, if the function is triggered by the click of a button, the <code>'n_clicks'</code> property of the button's callback's output will be taken as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last important class in the callbacks is <code>State()</code>. They take the value as the argument of the function, but, unlike the input class, it does not immediately trigger subsequent callbacks. State classes were used to extend the database, as they can be modified but the output only gets triggered once the button gets clicked.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "As you can imagine, every element is linked to many others, creating a deeply interconnected network. A simple user action usually results in a chain of several automatic re-evaluations of callbacks. The whole system can be summarised by the following image provided by Dash bootstrap. \n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify; max-width:90%\">\n",
    "The entry point of the package is the <code>run.py</code> file. The master <code>launch()</code> function is defined and called through here. It triggers the initialization of the Dash app. Then, the layout of the page is imported from the <code>layout.py</code> file, which contains every HTML div and Dash component displayed on the app. These interact to the file containing all the callback function definitions. In the latter, wrapping every definition inside a big function seems unnecessary, but it actually is the only elegant solution we could find to solve a common problem in Dash applications: circular import errors. In our project, calling <code>launch()</code> makes <code>app.py</code> run, which creates the <code>app</code> object. Then, the callbacks defined in <code>callbacks.py</code> need to be ran to ensure the functionaliy of the app. However, the callbacks require the existence of the app to be defined through the Dash macro <code>@app.callback()</code>, even though they are imported to <code>app.py</code> <em>before</em> the app is initialised. This leads to a <code>ModuleNotFoundError</code>. The solution to this was to define the callbacks <em>after</em> the app is initialized, which was done by wrapping their definitions in a function that would only be called after the initialization. A similar problem was met in the layout, as the colour scheme of the divs is \n",

    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify; max-width: 90%\">\n",
    "The first (and perhaps most important) difficulty was related to finding the adsorbents. Unfortunately, no machine-readable database with interesting caracteristics for the project could be found. The csv file containing the data was therefore done by hand, taking the results from a publication named <em>Recent Progress in CO2 Capture by Porous Solid Materials</em> [1] by C. Chen et al. This severely limited the amount of data present in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second difficulty was learning how to work with the libraries involved (mostly Dash), which involved using other languages such as CSS and HTML for the styling of the web app, as well as learning completely new control structures like callbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structuring the project also took a bit of quite a bit of thinking and tinkering, as many attempts were shut down by circular import errors. One culprit in particular was the callback system: each callback requires the existence of the app, but the app also needs the callbacks to exist, leading to a circular import error. This kind of problem was solved by wrapping the callback definitions in one gigantic function (<code>register_callbacks(app: Dash)</code>) that would only be called <em>after</em> app initialization. A similar issue was encountered in the layout module, which required to know which theme was active before the app was even created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difficulty was implementing the dark mode. The style of every div was initially hard coded before the discovery of Dash Bootstrap Components. It was therefore changed in the code, which actually turned out to be more complicated than expected (you can ask Arsenijs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing the dynamic point counter callback and data table also took ages, as it needed to work with the actual plotly figure as input to account for zooming etc., not just the dataframe containing all the data. As it turns out, that is a monstruosity composed of dicts and lists nested several layers deep, with varying data types in every single dict, and useful information buried amidst junk.
