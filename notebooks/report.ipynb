    "As of today, global warming remains the biggest challenge for the human race. There are, however, multiple ways of tackling the problem and one of those potential solutions is explored at EPFL by a team of dedicated students. Their method relies on capturing CO<sub>2</sub> directly from the atmosphere by the means of adsorbents. Adsorbent materials offer a useful property of accumulating a substance without causing any critical changes to either the adsorbent or the substance being adsorbed. The quality and the efficiency of the adsorbent is heavily reliant on a multitude of characteristics such as the pore volume which corresponds to the volume of the void spaces in the adsorbent or the BET surface area which is the total surface area available for adsorption per unit mass of material. The problem lies in the fact that one would have to not only read through thousands of papers when searching for the adsorbent but would also need to keep track of all of the work. That's when our project comes into play. \n",
    "The objective of this project was to offer a much easier way to visualize various existing adsorbents, compare them and potentially even find the ones that are suitable for specific conditions. \n",

    "### 1. Notion of callbacks \n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify ;margin-right:50px\">\n",
    "In Dash, a core mechanism are callbacks. Callbacks enable interactivity within the application, meaning they listen to what's being inputed by the user and give an output as a function of the inputs. For example, a user may have the ability to select a value using a dropdown option which is directly linked to a graph, table or another possible output. Our app runs exactly on these set of callbacks which make our app so easy to interact with. To link a callback to another one, the use of \"id\" were necessery. Indeed, before each function used in the application, the inputs, labeled with respective \"id\"s were used as arguments to the function, while the output, labeled with a different \"id\", was the returned element. Additionally, each callback, on top of having an \"id\", has a appropriate \"type\", such as a \"value\", a \"data\", \"children\" or \"n-clicks\". The type is chosen according to the element of the class that it modify. For example, if the function takes in a click of a button as its argument, the type of the callbacks will be \"n-clicks\". The last important class in the callbacks are the State() ones. As the Input, it takes the value as the argument of the function, but, unlike the input class, it does not immediately trigger a callback. State classes were used to extend the database, as they can be modified but the output only gets triggered once the button gets clicked.\n",

Dash Core Component (dcc) as well as Dash Bootstrap component (dbc) classes were added into each div to link the callbacks to the main page, connected by the \"id\".
