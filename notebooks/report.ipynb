    "Global warming is the main challenge for humans. Some methods are used to counter the progession of the increasing temperature and one particularly is treated by students, here at EPFL, in the CarbonTeam. The main interest of this association is to capture CO<sub>2</sub> using some adsorbents. Adsorbent materials offer a useful property of accumulating a substance without causing any critical changes to neither the adsorbent nor the substance being adsorbed. One adsorbent can be associated with many caracteristics, such as the type or some values as the Pore volume, which correspond to the total volume of \"holes\" or the BET Surface Area, which correspond to the physical adsorption of gas on the solid. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of these data are reported in a lot of lines in some CSV file and are complicated to extract or vizualise. The objective of this project is therefore to make a graphical representation of the Database to facilitate the search and the representation of different caracteristics. </div>"
