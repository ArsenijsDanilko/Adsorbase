    "As of today, global warming remains the biggest challenge for the human race. There are, however, multiple ways of tackling the problem and one of those potential solutions is explored at EPFL by a team of dedicated students. Their method relies on capturing CO<sub>2</sub> directly from the atmosphere by the means of adsorbents. Adsorbent materials offer a useful property of accumulating a substance without causing any critical changes to either the adsorbent or the substance being adsorbed. The quality and the efficiency of the adsorbent is heavily reliant on a multitude of characteristics such as the pore volume which corresponds to the volume of the void spaces in the adsorbent or the BET surface area which is the total surface area available for adsorption per unit mass of material. The problem lies in the fact that one would have to not only read through thousands of papers when searching for the adsorbent but would also need to keep track of all of the work. That's when our project comes into play. \n",
    "The objective of this project was to offer a much easier way to visualize various existing adsorbents, compare them and potentially even find the ones that are suitable for specific conditions. \n",
